<h1>Welcome to Collin's Programming Portfolio Website</h1>


Hello! My name is <strong>Collin Johnson</strong>. <br></br> 
My website contains my portolio of programs 
I have written for my CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island. I created 
this web page using the HTML programming language.  The Apps link above contains the applications I have written 
that run on phones.  The Javascripts link above has Javascripts that I have written to be imbedded in 
web pages.
